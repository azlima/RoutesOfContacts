RoutesOfContacts
================

The app shows the route between two chosen contact addresses registered in the device or between the device current position and one of these contact addresses, using the maps resource of Windows Phone.

For a correct operation of this app, you must change the key value "ApplicationId" in the "RoutesOfContacts/Config.xml" file by your Bing Maps Application Key.

If you still don't have a Bing Maps Application Key, get it now at https://www.bingmapsportal.com/ and replace the key value "ApplicationId" by your Bing Maps Application Key in the "RoutesOfContacts/Config.xml" file.
